This script processes an image by downloading it from a URL and performing various transformations using OpenCV.

    Image Download and Conversion: The image is downloaded using requests and converted into a format compatible with OpenCV.

    Resizing: The image is resized to 300x300 pixels for uniform processing.

    Grayscale Conversion: The resized image is converted to grayscale to simplify further operations.

    Smoothing: A Gaussian Blur is applied to reduce noise and smooth the grayscale image.

    Binarization: The image is converted into a binary format (black and white) using thresholding techniques, creating two versions:
        Binary Image: Pixels above a threshold are white (255), and below are black (0).
        Inverted Binary Image: The binary result is inverted (black and white reversed).

    Masking: The inverted binary image is used as a mask to selectively show parts of the original image.

    Visualization: The script displays the original resized image, grayscale image, binary image, and a combined result with all transformations for easy comparison.

Technologies Used: OpenCV for image processing, NumPy for array manipulation, and Google Colab for displaying images using cv2_imshow.
